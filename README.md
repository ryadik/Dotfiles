## ✨ Features

These dotfiles configure and manage the following key components:

*   **Zsh**: Main shell with Antigen and Oh-my-zsh.
*   **Tmux**: Terminal window manager.
*   **Neovim**: Uses pre-configured AstroVim (pulled in `install.sh` so it's not stored here and is always up-to-date).
*   **Kitty**: Main terminal.
*   **ASDF**: Used for managing Python and Node.js versions.
*   **Git**: Personal and work rules are configured.
*   **LazyGit**: GUI for Git in the terminal.
*   **VSCode**: All my using VSC Ext, settings and customizations.
*   **Gemini-CLI**: Configs for Gemini-cli.
*   **macOS Defaults**: Automated macOS settings for Finder, Dock. (Experimental)
*   **Stow**: For symlinking all configs from the repository to the correct locations in the home directory.

## 🚀 Requirements

*   **Mac**: All paths are set for Macs with Apple Silicon (M1 and higher).
*   **OS**: Tested only on the latest system.
*   **Utilities**: `curl` and `unzip` (usually pre-installed).

## 💻 Installation

### Git-Free

The installation process is designed for a **new or relatively clean macOS system**. If you already have `brew`, `nvm`, `pyenv`, or other version managers/packages installed, it is recommended to uninstall them first to avoid conflicts.

In the standard macOS terminal (`Terminal.app`), execute the following command.

```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/ryadik/dotfiles/archive/main.zip" -o "/tmp/dotfiles_temp.zip" && unzip -q "/tmp/dotfiles_temp.zip" -d "/tmp/" && mv "/tmp/dotfiles-main" "$HOME/.dotfiles" && rm "/tmp/dotfiles_temp.zip" && chmod +x "$HOME/.dotfiles/install.sh" && "$HOME/.dotfiles/install.sh"
```

This command will download the `Dotfiles` repository, extract it to `~/.dotfiles`, and then run the main `install.sh` script.

### Manual

If you already have `Git` installed, or want to download the repository yourself, it is recommended to place the files at `$HOME/.dotfiles/` (usually `$HOME = /Users/user_name = ~/`) to avoid path errors.

After you have downloaded the project, execute this command to make `install.sh` executable:

```bash
chmod +x "$HOME/.dotfiles/install.sh"
```

Then, run the `install.sh` script with the command:

```bash
$HOME/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

### After Running `install.sh`

1.  **Restart your terminal:** Close the current terminal and open a new one. This is necessary for Zsh to fully load all new settings, plugins, and environment variables.
2.  **Install Fonts (optional):** By default, JetBrains Mono Nerd Font will be used. Fonts are located in the `.dotfiles/data/fonts` folder. This will ensure correct display of icons and symbols in the terminal.
3.  **Configure SSH Keys (optional):** Add your SSH keys and configure `ssh-agent` if necessary for working with Git repositories.

## ⚙️ Usage and Management

*   **Updating Homebrew Packages:**
    To update all formulae and applications installed via Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew update && brew upgrade && brew bundle install --file="$HOME/.dotfiles/Brewfile"
    ```

*   **Dumping Changes to Brewfile:**
    If you have installed new packages manually via `brew install` or `brew cask install` and want to add them to your `Brewfile`:
    ```bash
    dfu
    ```
    This alias will commit changes automatically. **CHECK BEFORE PUSHING!**

*   **Restowing Dotfiles:**
    If you make changes to the source dotfiles and want to recreate the symlinks, use the alias:
    ```bash
    dfs
    ```
*   **Language Version Management (ASDF):**
    *   Install a new Python version:
        ```bash
        asdf install python <version>
        ```
    *   Install a new NodeJS version:
        ```bash
        asdf install nodejs <version>
        ```

## ⌨️ Hotkeys and Aliases

There are many different aliases for various tasks, custom hotkeys, and redefinitions of default ones. For example, for **Tmux**, the **prefix:** is redefined to `Ctrl+a` (instead of `Ctrl+b`); for **Git** there is an abbreviation `g` for `git`.
More details can be found in the configs themselves. Aliases are located in `.dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc`. Hotkeys are individually defined in their respective configs.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

*   **"Command not found"**: Ensure your terminal has been restarted after installation. Check your `$PATH` (`echo $PATH`).
*   **Symbol/Icon display issues**: Make sure you have installed Nerd Fonts (e.g., JetBrains Mono Nerd Font) in macOS and selected them in your Kitty settings.
